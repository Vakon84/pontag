A logitech serial mouse with wheel presents itself with the following sequence:
```
0x4D - 'M'
0x5A - 'Z'
0x40 - '@'
0x00
0x00
0x00
```

These bytes are also followed by this sequence
```
0x08 0x01 0x24 0x2c
0x27 0x29 0x18 0x10
0x15 0x10 0x3c 0x3c
0x2d 0x2f 0x35 0x33
0x25 0x3c 0x30 0x2e
0x30 0x10 0x26 0x10
0x18 0x0c 0x30 0x2e
0x30 0x10 0x26 0x10
0x23 0x18 0x22 0x09 
```
It also communicates with the standard 4-byte Microsoft wheel mouse protocol
